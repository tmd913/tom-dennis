            Hi! My name is Tom, and I was born and raised in Wyomissing, PA
            (about an hour NW of Philadelphia). Throughout my childhood I was
            always a bit of a nerd, especially when it came to technology.
            Phones, computers, videogame consoles, and any other electronics I
            could get my hands on fascinated me, but although I loved various
            forms of technology, I never really understood how they worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got my first major exposure to the software on these devices
            during an introductory Computer Science course my sophomore year at
            the University of Richmond, and I liked the material so much that I
            decided to major in Computer Science. This decision ended up being a
            great one, as I learned a ton of fundamental coding skills and
            became a much better problem solver, but even after three years as a
            Computer Science major I still didnâ€™t know how to build a real world
            software application. Despite doing well in my classes, I began to
            mistakenly doubt my abilities as a developer and I ultimately
            decided to pursue a consulting job after graduation rather than
            enter the technology industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            My first job in consulting led me to Washington, DC, and although
            after about a year I realized that consulting lacked the creativity
            that I enjoyed most as a Computer Science major, I did learn a lot
            about myself throughout the process and ended up in a city that I
            love. With the support of my family and friends I decided once again
            to pursue my goal of becoming a software developer by completing
            George Washington University's Web Development Bootcamp, an
            invaluable experience that augmented my academic knowledge as a
            Computer Science major with hands on exposure to full-stack web
            application development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I now know that there was no reason to ever doubt myself as a
            developer, all I needed was a push in the right direction.
            Technology is my passion, and I am hopeful and excited that I will
            soon find my dream job using the skills that I have developed
            throughout the past several years!
